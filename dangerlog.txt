1. When we tested the socket connection, it couldn't get the correct hostname and port. After carefully checking the
request parsing function, we found that the hostname was parsed incorrectly. We modified it, and it worked then.
2. The response couldn't be retrieved from cache, because the status of the request wasn't be parsed correctly.
After we fixed the status parsing function, cache can work normally. 
3. When we tried to run the proxy to test daemon codes, the socket connection establishment failed. After checking
the running processes, we realized there's already a socket connection on the same port after our previous testing on 
daemon. So we killed this ongoing process, and ran tests successfully.
